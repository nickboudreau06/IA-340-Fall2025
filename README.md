# IA-340-Fall2025
This is my IA [340](https://catalog.jmu.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=50&coid=258336&print) repository for labs and projects for the fall 2025 semester 

## Purpose
This repository contains projects and assignments for **IA 340**: *Data Mining, Modeling and Knowledge Discovery*. It serves as a workspace to develop, document, and share data mining techniques, including data preprocessing, pattern discovery, and predictive modeling, as part of the course curriculum.

## Data Mining 
**Data mining** is the nontrivial extraction of previously unknown and potentially useful information from (large) data sets to help explain current behaviors and anticipate future outcomes. Students will apply data mining and knowledge discovery methods to data sets from business, industry, and government. The course is team oriented, project based, and grounded in the relevant legal and ethical context.
